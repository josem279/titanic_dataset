## Purpose

![Image of Titanic Challenge as detailed on Kaggle](Images/titanic_purpose.PNG)

As detailed in Kaggle in the image above, the purpose of this challenge is to examine data regarding the sinking of the Titanic to build a predictive model of survivability.

I will attempt to answer the following questions in my own analysis of this dataset:

- Did wealth determine how likely you were to survive? If so by how much?

- Was age a determining factor in a person's survivability rate?

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

This part of the analysis focuses on familiarizing ourselves with the data and exploring it for any potential problems or special considerations.

A good place to start is to look at the columns of the training data and their respective data type. This ensures that all data collected will be able to be manipulated accordingly.

Right away we can see a couple of problems with the data.s
